# Pata Data
A way to access World Bank APIs for open datasets. 

## Introduction :point_up:

Pata Data is an Android application designed to get World Bank data and display it. It is 
built on top of the [Android Volley Framework] (https://developer.android.com/training/volley/index.html).

## Abilities :muscle:

This app has the superpowers to:
* fetch (some relevant) World Bank datasets about Kenya in JSON form.
* display those datasets in a scrollable list.
* and in graph form.

## Limitations :worried:

This app is currently unable to:
* fetch datasets about another country.

## Possible Future Work :fast_forward:

As of today Tuesday, May 24, 2016, some of the things that should be implemented are:
- [ ] A settings section for user customization.

## Other things :books:

This is my first uploaded app that I apploaded myself. :bowtie:

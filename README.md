# pata-data
A way to access World Bank APIs for open datasets. 

## Introduction

Pata Data is an Android application designed to get World Bank data and display it. It is 
built on top of the [Android Volley Framework] (https://developer.android.com/training/volley/index.html).

## Abilities

This app has the superpowers :muscle: to:
* fetch (some relevant) World Bank datasets about Kenya in JSON form.
* display those datasets in a scrollable list.

## Limitations

This app is currently unable :-1: to:
* fetch datasets about another country.
* display data in graph form. :frowning:

## Future plans

As of today Wednesday, May 18, 2016, some of the things that should be implemented are:
- [ ] Display data in graph form.
- [ ] Make the loading button actually rotate
- [ ] Make orientation work correctly while loading

## Other things

This is my first uploaded app that I apploaded myself. :bowtie:
